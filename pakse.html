        <h2>Wat Phou</h2>
        <p>Wat Phou is a ruined Khmer Hindu temple complex in southern Laos.
          It is at the base of mount Phou Khao, some 6 kilometres (3.7 mi)
          from the Mekong in Champasak Province. There was a temple on the site as
          early as the 5th century, but the surviving structures date from the
          11th to 13th centuries. It has a unique structure:
          The elements lead to a shrine where a lingam dedicated to
          Lord Shiva was bathed in water from a mountain spring.
          The site later became a centre of Theravada Buddhist worship,
          which it remains today.</p>

        <p>The Bolaven Plateau is an elevated region in southern Laos.
          Most of the plateau is located within Champasak Province of Laos,
          though the edges of the plateau are also located in Salavan,
          Sekong and Attapeu Provinces. It is located between the Annamite Mountain Range,

          (3,280 to 4,430 ft) above sea level. The plateau is crossed by several rivers
          and has many scenic waterfalls.</p>
