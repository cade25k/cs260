    <div class="city-description">
      Vientiane is the capital and largest city of Laos,
      on the banks of the Mekong River near the border with Thailand.
      Vientiane became the capital in 1573, due to fears of a Burmese invasion,
      but was later looted, then razed to the ground in 1827 by the Siamese (Thai).
      Vientiane was the administrative capital during French rule and,
      due to economic growth in recent times, is now the economic center of Laos.
      The city had a population of 948,477 as of the 2020 Census.

        <h2>Patuxai Monument</h2>
        <p>Patuxai (literally meaning Victory Gate or Gate of Triumph)
          is a war monument in the centre of Vientiane, Laos, built between 1957 and 1968.
          The Patuxai was dedicated to those who fought in the struggle for independence from France.
          In romanising the name from the Laotian language,
          it is variously transliterated as Patuxai, Patuxay, Patousai and Patusai.
          It is also called Patuxai Arch or the Arc de Triomphe of Vientiane as it
          resembles the Arc de Triomphe in Paris. However, it is typically Laotian in design,
          decorated with mythological creatures such as the kinnari (half-female, half-bird).</p>

        <h2>That Luang</h2>
        <p>Pha That Luang is a gold-covered large Buddhist stupa in the centre of the city of Vientiane,
          Laos. Since its initial establishment, suggested to be in the 3rd century,
          the stupa has undergone several reconstructions as recently as the 1930s due to foreign invasions of the area.
          It is generally regarded as the most important national monument in Laos and a national symbol.</p>

        <h2>Buddha Park</h2>
        <p>Buddha Park, also known as Xieng Khuan, is a sculpture park located 25 km southeast from Vientiane,
          Laos in a meadow by the Mekong River. Although it is not a temple (Wat), the park may be referred to as
          Wat Xieng Khuan, since it contains numerous religious images.
          The name Xieng Khuan means Spirit City. The park contains over 200 Hindu and Buddhist statues.
          The socialist government operates Buddha Park as a tourist attraction and public park.</p>
