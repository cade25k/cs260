    <div class="city-description">
      Luang Prabang, literally meaning "Royal Buddha Image", is a city in north central Laos,
      consisting of 58 adjacent villages, of which 33 comprise the UNESCO Town Of Luang Prabang World Heritage Site.
      It was listed in 1995 for unique and "remarkably" well preserved architectural, religious and cultural heritage,
      a blend of the rural and urban developments over several centuries,
      including the French colonial influences during the 19th and 20th centuries.

        <h2>Phou Si</h2>
        <p>Mount Phou Si, also written Mount Phu Si, is a 100 m (328 ft)
          high hill in the centre of the old town of Luang Prabang in Laos.
          It lies in the heart of the old town peninsula and is bordered on one side by the Mekong River
          and on the other side by the Nam Khan River. The hill is a local religious site,
          and houses several Buddhist shrines.</p>

        <h2>Kuang Si Falls</h2>
        <p>The Kuang Si Falls or Kuang Xi Falls, alternatively known as the Tat Kuang Si Waterfalls,
          is a three-tiered waterfall about 29 kilometers (18 mi) south of Luang Prabang.
          The waterfalls are a favorite side trip for tourists in Luang Prabang,
          and begin in shallow pools atop a steep hillside. These lead to the main fall
          with a drop of 60 meters (200 ft).</p>

        <h2>Royal Palace</h2>
        <p>The Royal Palace in Luang Prabang, Laos, was built in 1904 during the French colonial era
          for King Sisavang Vong and his family. The site for the palace was chosen
          so that official visitors to Luang Prabang could disembark from their
          river voyages directly below the palace and be received there.
          After the death of King Sisavang Vong, the Crown Prince Savang Vatthana
          and his family were the last to occupy the grounds.
          In 1975, the monarchy was overthrown by the communists and the
          royal family were taken to re-education camps.
          The palace was then converted into a national museum.</p>
